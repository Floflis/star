Please have a look at the German open Source Center BerliOS at www.berlios.de
BerliOS will continue to support free hosting of cryptography projects even
when US laws change and don't allow to host cryptography projects in the USA.
Also look at sourcewell.berlios.de, the first Open Source announcement service

Star is the fastest tar archiver for UNIX

Star has many improvements compared to other tar 
implementations (including gnu tar). See below for a short description
of the highlight of star.

Star is located on:

ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/star

Changes since star-1.4.2:

-	Support for BSDi version 4.x

-	Suport for BSDi on sparc

-	Support for sparc64 FreeBSD

-	Support for i786-cygwin

-	Added +DAportable to the HP-UX cc compiler flags

-	New Platform 9000-831-hp-ux-cc

-	Added floatingpint printing support for OS/2

-	Added support for macppc-netbsd-cc NetBSD on MAC

-	Workaround for an OpenBSD bug in ctype.h (illegaly #defines EOF)

-	Added IPv6 support to 'rmt'

-	Better casting for debug printf() in 'rmt'

-	Better autoconfiguration for librmt and its users yields in better
	compilation and portability results for OS that do not support the 
	needed internet features for remote tape support.

-	Special support for an undocumented but unfortunately important
	"feature" for symlinks on HP-UX.

	Now star tries to retain the permissions of a symlink by
	setting umask() before creating the symlink.

-	Fixed a bug that caused star to be unable to correctly deal with
	ACLs where the user or group name contains spaces.

-	Workaround for reading rotten archives caused by above bug.

-	Fixed a bug that caused star to create broken archives if
	the POSIX.1-2001 extended format is used for sparse files > 8 GB.
	For this reason, a new extended header tag SCHILY.realsize has
	been added.

-	Fixed a bug that caused star to dump core on UNIX-98 TAR compat mode
	with e.g. 'star cbv' because star did not check for the missing arg to
	the -b option.

-	'star -n -tpath ...' now only prints the pathnames to allow
	to use the ooutput directly in scripts. If you like the old
	behavior, use 'star -nv ...'

-------------------------------------------------------------
Star is the fastest known implementation of a tar archiver.
Star is able to make backups with far more than 10MB/s if the
disk and tape drive support such a speed. This is more than
double the speed that ufsdump will get.
In 1996, Ampex got 13.5 MB/s with their DLT tape drive which is a
modified professional digital video tape drive and not related
to Quantum's DLT type drives.
Ufsdump got a maximum speed of about 6MB/s with the same hardware.

Star development started 1982, the first complete implementation has 
been done in 1985. I never did my backups with other tools than star.

Its main advantages over other tar implementations are:

	fifo			- keeps the tape streaming.
				  This gives you faster backups than
				  you can achieve with ufsdump, if the
				  size of the filesystem is > 1 GByte.

	remote tape support	- a fast RMT implementation that has no
				  problems to saturate a 100 Mb/s network.

	accurate sparse files	- star is able to reproduce holes in sparse
				  files accurately if the OS includes 
				  the needed support functions. This is
				  currently true for Solaris-2.3 to
				  Solaris-2.5.1

	pattern matcher		- for a convenient user interface
				  (see manual page for more details).
				  To archive/extract a subset of files.

	sophisticated diff	- user tailorable interface for comparing
				  tar archives against file trees
				  This is one of the most interesting parts
				  of the star implementation.

	no namelen limitation	- Pathnames up to 1024 Bytes may be archived.
				  (The same limitation applies to linknames)
				  This limit may be expanded in future
				  without changing the method to record
				  long names.

	deals with all 3 times	- stores/restores all 3 times of a file
				  (even creation time)
				  With POSIX.1-2001 the times are in nanosecond
				  granularity.
				  Star may reset access time after doing
				  backup. On Solaris this can be done without
				  changing the ctime.

	does not clobber files	- more recent copies on disk will not be 
				  clobbered from tape
				  This may be the main advantage over other
				  tar implementations. This allows
				  automatically repairing of corruptions
				  after a crash & fsck (Check for differences
				  after doing this with the diff option).

	automatic byte swap	- star automatically detects swapped archives
				  and transparently reads them the right way

	automatic format detect	- star automatically detects several common
				  archive formats and adopts to them.
				  Supported archive types are:
				  Old tar, gnu tar, ansi tar, star,
				  POSIX.1-2001 PAX, Sun's Solaris tar.


	automatic compression detect - star automatically detects whether the
				  archive is compressed. If it has been
				  compressed with a compression program that
				  is compatible to decompression with "gzip"
				  or "bzip2", star automatically activates
				  decompression.

	fully ansi compatible	- Star is fully ANSI/Posix 1003.1 compatible.
				  See README.otherbugs for a complete
				  description of bugs found in other tar
				  implementations. Star is the first tar
				  implementation that supports POSIX.1-2001.

	support for ACLs and file flags - star supports Access Control Lists
				  and extended file flags (as found on FreeBSD
				  and Linux). Support to archive and restore
				  other file properties may easily added.

	support for all inode metadata - star supports to put all inode
				  metadata on the archive. This allows future
				  versions of star to perform true
				  incremental dumps.

Have a look at the manual page, it is included in the distribution.
