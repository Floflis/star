NOTE: Before blaming star for something found in this list, look at your favorite
	tar implementation for the presence of similar bugs/missing features.


-	Better telldir() error handling (break; in directory read loop???)

-	Deal with problems with maxopenfiles (> 255 & uchar in stdio)

-	Need a way to handle backups that include /export/home & /home: Missing links
	message because loopback filesystem gives more hardlinks than really present.

-	Handle unknown filetypes in a better way (they are not flagged - only 
	handled as regular files - according to Posix - at present time)

-	Implement BUGS from HPUX that made it into IEC-9945-1 (Posix 1003.1):
	(SYMTYPE, CHRTYPE, BLKTYPE & FIFOTYPE may have size != 0)

-	Sockets (not supported in ANSI) should not be dumped.

-	Command chain:
	limit filesize xxxx
	star -c f=ccc . 
	Sync pipe read error or
	with option -no_fifo Condition not caught: file_write_error

-	Linkcount below zero with the command: star -c /usr/bin /usr/bin

-	Add Option to both (verbose print & errors) appear on stderr.

-	From my point of view, HP-UX is not Posix 1003.1 compliant.
	Posix 1003.1 wants major/minor device numbers to be represented
	in a octal 8 byte string with a blank or a null byte as terminator.
	This gives 7 octal numbers == 7*3 == 21 bits.
	For that reason a dev may have at most 21 bits in 
	the minor device number.

	HP-UX uses 24 bits in minor device numbers this forces
	8 octal digits for representation.
	HP-UX therefore is not Posix 1003.1 because it 
	cannot have a NULL Byte as terminator for the 
	minor device number representation.

-	Expand some of the fundamental types to 64 bits to be 
	able to handle files > 2GB.

-	Big file strategy: see README.largefiles

-	Add support for access control lists.
	Is the method used with Solaris tar the right way??

-	Add support for 4.4BSD filesystem flags and Linux ext2 filesystem flags.

-	malloc path buffers and 'chdir' to be able to deal with pathnames > 1024 bytes.

-	add an option to reduce primary file name length to 99 chars
	for all formats to enhance the portability of the archives.

-	union member .dbuf is still star_header!!!

-	star .. | star ... ^\ sometimes dies fom signal if using POSIX signals ??

-	Add POSIX-2001 support for the major()/minor() handling in FreeBSD
	0x0000FF00 Major and 0xFFFF00FF Minor
	It currently uses the bigfile strategy with base 256 coding to allow
	56 bits in 7 bytes.

-	If -p flag is ommited, files are handled different from old tar. 
	Star always does does a chmod on non directories.
	Tar uses creat(file, st_mode & 0x07777)

-	AIX uses tape.h ??? for mt ioctl's

-	Size for hard links cannot be checked!!!

-	update/append only for files/devices !!!
