Linux includes the gnu make program by default but it is called 'make' on linux.
You will definitely need the shell script Gmake.linux to use gmake
on a linux system.

Install it as /usr/bin/Gmake with:

cp Gmake.linux /usr/bin/Gmake

Then compile the system by calling:

/usr/bin/Gmake
or ./Gmake.linux
