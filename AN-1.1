Star is the fastest tar archiver for UNIX

Star has many improvements compared to other tar 
imlementations (including gnu tar). See below for a short description
of the highlight of star.

Star is located on:

ftp://ftp.fokus.gmd.de/pub/unix/star

Changes since star-1.0:
	Better manual, better examples in the manual.
	Add a -xdir flag to force extraction of directories regardless of time stamp.
	Changed max number of patterns from 10 to 100.
	First implementation of the -z flag.
	Don't dump archive if it is a file.
	Finally implement -C option even working in extract mode.
	Star now defaults to 100% ansi if it is called as 'ustar'
		(add ustar hardlink to star)
	Fifo size may be controlled by STAR_FIFO_SIZE environment
	Diff behaviour optimized to give less misleading output
	EOF error messages better for better understanding of GNU tar EOF bug
	Limit name length for old tar & GNU tar to 99 chars
	New options -force_remove -ask_remove -remove_first -remove_recursive
	New option -nullout to get the size of the archive as fast as possible
	Many speed enhancements: Now using 40% less user CPU time.
	Bug fix for -sparse (star & xstar format)
	Compiles again on AIX (use setenv COPTX -DNO_FLOATINGPOINT before)

-------------------------------------------------------------
Star is the fastest known implementation of a tar archiver.
Star is able to make backups with more than 12MB/s if the
disk and tape drive support such a speed. This is more than
double the speed that ufsdump will get.
Ampex got 13.5 MB/s with their new DLT tape drive.
Ufsdump got a maximum speed of about 6MB/s with the same hardware.

Star development started 1982, development is still in progress.
The current version of star is stable and 
I never did my backups with other tools than star.

Its main advantages over other tar implementations are:

	fifo			- keeps the tape streaming.
				  This gives you faster backups than
				  you can achieve with ufsdump, if the
				  size of the filesystem is > 1 GByte.

	pattern matcher		- for a convenient user interface
				  (see manual page for more details).
				  To archive/extract a subset of files.

	sophisticated diff	- user tailorable interface for comparing
				  tar archives against file trees
				  This is one of the most interesting parts
				  of the star implementation.

	no namelen limitation	- Pathnames up to 1024 Bytes may be archived.
				  (The same limitation applies to linknames)
				  This limit may be expanded in future
				  without changing the method to record long names.

	deals with all 3 times	- stores/restores all 3 times of a file
				  (even creation time)
				  may reset access time after doing backup

	does not clobber files	- more recent copies on disk will not be 
				  clobbered from tape
				  This may be the main advantage over other
				  tar implementations. This allows
				  automatically repairing of corruptions
				  after a crash & fsck (Check for differences
				  after doing this with the diff option).

	automatic byte swap	- star automatically detects swapped archives
				  and transparently reads them the right way

	automatic format detect	- star automatically detects several common
				  archive formats and adopts to them.
				  Supported archive types are:
				  Old tar, gnu tar, ansi tar, star.

	fully ansi compatible	- Star is fully ANSI/Posix 1003.1 compatible.
				  See README.otherbugs for a complete description
				  of bugs found in other tar implementations.

Have a look at the manual page, it is included in the distribution.
