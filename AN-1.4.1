Please have a look at the German open Source Center BerliOS at www.berlios.de
BerliOS will continue to support free hosting of cryptography projects even
when US laws change and don't allow to host cryptography projects in the USA.
Also look at sourcewell.berlios.de, the first Open Source announcement service

Star is the fastest tar archiver for UNIX

Star has many improvements compared to other tar 
implementations (including gnu tar). See below for a short description
of the highlight of star.

Star is located on:

ftp://ftp.fokus.gmd.de/pub/unix/star

Changes since star-1.4:

-	Fixed a bug introduced by applying a patch from 8.3.2002
	from Andreas Gruenbacher <ag@bestbits.at>

	The bug caused a needed ',' to be ommited from the ACL string
	in extract mode if the target platform did not have named entries
	in the passwd file and the ACL string was converted to use the 
	numeric user id instead.

-	Fixed a bug that caused star to complain

		"star: Cannot handle multi volume archives from/to stdin/stdout."

	if called "star -c f=- ..." or "star cf - ...".

-	Better OS/2 compatibility

-	Fixed a minor bug that caused star not to behave correctly if the
	POSIX filename prefix is exactly 155 chars and the reserved field
	in the tar header that directly follows the prefix did contain
	non null characters.

-	Do not emmit base 256 charcaters for archive formats that do not
	understand base 256


-	New program "tartest" reads TAR archives from "stdin" and prints
	a list of non-compliances with POSIX.1-1990

	Call e.g.
			tar cf - | tartest

	To check your favorite TAR implementation against POSIX.1-1990

	Check README.quicktest in ftp://ftp.fokus.gmd.de/pub/unix/star/testscripts
	for more information.

-------------------------------------------------------------
Star is the fastest known implementation of a tar archiver.
Star is able to make backups with far more than 10MB/s if the
disk and tape drive support such a speed. This is more than
double the speed that ufsdump will get.
In 1996, Ampex got 13.5 MB/s with their DLT tape drive which is a
modified professional digital video tape drive and not related
to Quantum's DLT type drives.
Ufsdump got a maximum speed of about 6MB/s with the same hardware.

Star development started 1982, the first complete implementation has 
been done in 1985. I never did my backups with other tools than star.

Its main advantages over other tar implementations are:

	fifo			- keeps the tape streaming.
				  This gives you faster backups than
				  you can achieve with ufsdump, if the
				  size of the filesystem is > 1 GByte.

	remote tape support	- a fast RMT implementation that has no
				  probems to saturate a 100 Mb/s network.

	accurate sparse files	- star is able to reproduce holes in sparse
				  files accurately if the OS includes 
				  the needed support functions. This is
				  currently true for Solaris-2.3 to
				  Solaris-2.5.1

	pattern matcher		- for a convenient user interface
				  (see manual page for more details).
				  To archive/extract a subset of files.

	sophisticated diff	- user tailorable interface for comparing
				  tar archives against file trees
				  This is one of the most interesting parts
				  of the star implementation.

	no namelen limitation	- Pathnames up to 1024 Bytes may be archived.
				  (The same limitation applies to linknames)
				  This limit may be expanded in future
				  without changing the method to record
				  long names.

	deals with all 3 times	- stores/restores all 3 times of a file
				  (even creation time)
				  With POSIX.1-2001 the times are in nanosecond
				  granularity.
				  Star may reset access time after doing
				  backup. On Solaris this can be done without
				  changing the ctime.

	does not clobber files	- more recent copies on disk will not be 
				  clobbered from tape
				  This may be the main advantage over other
				  tar implementations. This allows
				  automatically repairing of corruptions
				  after a crash & fsck (Check for differences
				  after doing this with the diff option).

	automatic byte swap	- star automatically detects swapped archives
				  and transparently reads them the right way

	automatic format detect	- star automatically detects several common
				  archive formats and adopts to them.
				  Supported archive types are:
				  Old tar, gnu tar, ansi tar, star,
				  POSIX.1-2001 PAX, Sun's Solaris tar.


	automatic compression detect - star automatically detects whether the
				  archive is compressed. If it has been
				  compressed with a compression program that
				  is compatible to decompression with "gzip"
				  or "bzip2", star automatically activates
				  decompression.

	fully ansi compatible	- Star is fully ANSI/Posix 1003.1 compatible.
				  See README.otherbugs for a complete
				  description of bugs found in other tar
				  implementations. Star is the first tar
				  implementation that supports POSIX.1-2001.

	support for ACLs and file flags - star supports Access Control Lists
				  and extened file flags (as found on FreeBSD
				  and Linux). Support to archive and restore
				  other file properties may easily added.

	support for all inode metadata - star supports to put all inode
				  metadata on the archive. This allows future
				  versions of star to perform true
				  incremental dumps.

Have a look at the manual page, it is included in the distribution.
